# Pre-trained vs Chatbot approach

This is a simple Flask web application that allows you to experiment with Large Language Models via the Replicate API.
The aim of the app is to compare the outputs of a pre-trained model vs a chatbot model.

The app is intended to be deployed on Render, but it is currently not deployed.
